The heat of wealth burnt up a good name like fire. An illustration is that when an expensive stone like a ruby was set into a ring, then it showed the aspect of fire. Since a ruby is only set into the rings of rich people, and it has a similitude with fire, the claim of the first line has been proved.",

Thus along with this, the substance/profit of the burden of the gaze-game and and heart-stealing is hidden in the neck-slit of longing. That is, having seen in the mirror her own beauty and heart-stealingness, the beloved feels a longing that others too would see her, would fall in love with her, and would pay the tribute due to beauty.",

As for naqsh faryādī :\n        In Iran there is the custom that the seeker of justice [dād-ḳhvāh], putting on paper garments,\n        goes before the ruler-- as in the case of lighting a torch in\n        the day, or carrying a blood-soaked cloth on a bamboo pole [to\n        protest an injustice]. Thus the poet reflects, of whose\n        mischievousness of writing is the image a plaintiff? --since the\n        aspect of a picture is that its garment is of paper. That is to\n        say, although existence may be like that of pictures, merely\n        notional [ětibār-e maḥaẓ], it is a\n        cause of grief and sorrow and suffering.",

    "interpretation": "[July 29, 1862, to Majruh:] Speaking of the rainy season, first listen to an overview. There was the revolt of the blacks; then the tumult of the whites; then the disturbance of the demolition of houses; then the disaster of the epidemics; then the difficulty of the famine. Now this rainy season is all of them rolled into one. Today is the twenty-first day. The sun is visible here and there the way lightning flashes. At night, if sometimes the stars can be seen, people take them for fireflies. In the dark nights, thieves flourish. Not a day passes without news of burglaries at three or four houses. Don't think it's an exaggeration-- thousands of houses have collapsed, hundreds of people have been crushed to death. In every lane, a river flows. To make a long story short, the earlier famine was caused by the failure of the rains; grain did not grow. This one is a water-famine: so much rain fell that the sown seeds were washed away. Those who haven't yet sown, have held back from sowing. You've heard the state of things in Delhi. Other than this, there's nothing new.",

Now this rainy season is all of them rolled into one. Today is the twenty-first day. The sun is visible here and there the way lightning flashes. At night, if sometimes the stars can be seen, people take them for fireflies. In the dark nights, thieves flourish. Not a day passes without news of burglaries at three or four houses. Don't think it's an exaggeration-- thousands of houses have collapsed, hundreds of people have been crushed to death. In every lane, a river flows. To make a long story short, the earlier famine was caused by the failure of the rains; grain did not grow. This one is a water-famine: so much rain fell that the sown seeds were washed away. Those who haven't yet sown, have held back from sowing. You've heard the state of things in Delhi. Other than this, there's nothing new.",

The meaning is that there was hopelessness about obtaining wine, and the   ḳhumār had gone beyond the limit; thus when he sat down to write the theme of ḳhumār , then in the preface he wrote down the 'lane of the wave' as the 'shore'. That is, although in the gathering of the Cupbearer an ocean of wine was rippling, the cup of my destiny seemed to me to be empty.",

    "interpretation": "That is, the mirror's insolent expression of desire is that it stares intently at the beloved's beauty; and in reaction, the beloved stares into the mirror. This very thing is the 'burden of the gaze-game' and the substance/profit of heart-stealing and belovedness: that if there would be the springtime of beauty, then there would also be viewers of this beauty. But here, in a reversal, the viewer of the springtime of beauty is the beloved herself. Thus along with this, the substance/profit of the burden of the gaze-game and and heart-stealing is hidden in the neck-slit of longing. That is, having seen in the mirror her own beauty and heart-stealingness, the beloved feels a longing that others too would see her, would fall in love with her, and would pay the tribute due to beauty.",

Now this rainy season is all of them rolled into one. Today is the twenty-first day. The sun is visible here and there the way lightning flashes. At night, if sometimes the stars can be seen, people take them for fireflies. In the dark nights, thieves flourish. Not a day passes without news of burglaries at three or four houses. Don't think it's an exaggeration-- thousands of houses have collapsed, hundreds of people have been crushed to death. In every lane, a river flows. To make a long story short, the earlier famine was caused by the failure of the rains; grain did not grow. This one is a water-famine: so much rain fell that the sown seeds were washed away. Those who haven't yet sown, have held back from sowing. You've heard the state of things in Delhi. Other than this, there's nothing new.",

Thus the poet reflects, of whose\n        mischievousness of writing is the image a plaintiff? --since the\n        aspect of a picture is that its garment is of paper. That is to\n        say, although existence may be like that of pictures, merely\n        notional [ětibār-e maḥaẓ], it is a\n        cause of grief and sorrow and suffering.",

Here, what is meant is a 'wave of wine' [mauj-e sharāb]. ḳhamyāzah = yawn, it is used as a metaphor for the stretch of the shore; a wave too has a similitude with a yawn, and  ḳhumār necessarily has a yawn. The meaning is that there was hopelessness about obtaining wine, and the   ḳhumār had gone beyond the limit; thus when he sat down to write the theme of ḳhumār , then in the preface he wrote down the 'lane of the wave' as the 'shore'. That is, although in the gathering of the Cupbearer an ocean of wine was rippling, the cup of my destiny seemed to me to be empty.",
