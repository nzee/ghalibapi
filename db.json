Don't think it's an exaggeration-- thousands of houses have collapsed, hundreds of people have been crushed to death. In every lane, a river flows. To make a long story short, the earlier famine was caused by the failure of the rains; grain did not grow. This one is a water-famine: so much rain fell that the sown seeds were washed away.

At night, if sometimes the stars can be seen, people take them for fireflies. In the dark nights, thieves flourish. Not a day passes without news of burglaries at three or four houses. Don't think it's an exaggeration-- thousands of houses have collapsed, hundreds of people have been crushed to death. In every lane, a river flows. To make a long story short, the earlier famine was caused by the failure of the rains; grain did not grow. This one is a water-famine: so much rain fell that the sown seeds were washed away. Those who haven't yet sown, have held back from sowing. You've heard the state of things in Delhi. Other than this, there's nothing new.",

Now there's no viewing-site \n    left to see. Now the ardor for the revealing of the secrets of True Reality \n    is empty. If only our stroll were not so lofty, and when we obtained access \n    to the heavens, then we would be attentive to the viewing-site beyond the \n    heavens.
